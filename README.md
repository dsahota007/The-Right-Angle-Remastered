# The-Right-Angle-Remastered (Created In Unity Engine)

The Right Angle Game is a challenging platformer created in the Unity Engine taken from the Godot Engine, where you play as a determined triangle 
striving to launch yourself to the top. Precision and strategy are key as you navigate tricky angles and perilous heights. 
But beware—one wrong move, and you’ll fall, facing the consequences of your failure. Can you reach the peak, or will gravity get the best of you?
